# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A Codex plugin and marketplace (`codex plugin marketplace add openreadout/agent-plugins`) and a Gemini CLI extension (`gemini extensions install https://github.com/openreadout/agent-plugins`).
- Thermo `.raw` files from current instruments are validated against their depositors' conversions: Orbitrap Astral (Astral-analyzer `ASTMS` scans, DIA), Ascend, Eclipse, IQ-X and ID-X, FAIMS compensation voltages (`cv=`), TSQ Altis Plus SRM runs, TSQ 9610 and ISQ GC full scans, and file versions 57, 61 and 62 (LTQ, LTQ Orbitrap and LTQ FT runs from 2005–2008).

### Changed

- The Claude Code plugin, the Codex plugin and the Gemini CLI extension install from their own repository, [openreadout/agent-plugins](https://github.com/openreadout/agent-plugins), which the release workflow updates. Add the Claude Code marketplace again with `/plugin marketplace add openreadout/agent-plugins`.
- A privacy policy, `PRIVACY.md`, linked from the README, the docs site and the `.mcpb` manifest.

### Fixed

- The Claude Code plugin failed to load because its marketplace entry and `plugin.json` both declared the skill.
- The Homebrew formula and winget manifests attached to a release no longer start with the template's header comment.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-02

The first public release.

### Added

- Readers for raw files from microscopes, screening systems, flow cytometers, electrophysiology rigs, NMR and optical spectrometers, mass spectrometers, chromatographs, plate readers, qPCR cyclers and other bench instruments. `openreadout self formats` lists them with their validation level.
- Sixteen commands: `info`, `check`, `preview`, `stats`, `trace`, `table`, `spectra`, `analyze`, `export`, `batch`, `link`, `index`, `search`, `watch`, `self` and `mcp`.
- JSON output on every command, with published JSON Schemas and documented exit codes.
- Verified export to OME-TIFF, OME-Zarr, mzML, CSV, Parquet, Arrow, NWB, JCAMP-DX, Allotrope ASM and RDML.
- Analyses of chromatograms, peaks, plate assays, qPCR, NMR spectra, patch-clamp recordings, extracellular spikes and flow-cytometry gates.
- An MCP server, an agent skill and a Claude Code plugin.
- A Python package with bioio and napari plugins, an R package, a WebAssembly build, and Nextflow, Galaxy and Snakemake integrations.
- A documentation website: task recipes with real output, a searchable format list taken from `self formats`, a JSON reference rendered from the published schemas, and a browser demo.
