## [Unreleased]

The first public release.

### Added

- Readers for raw files from microscopes, screening systems, flow cytometers, electrophysiology rigs, NMR and optical spectrometers, mass spectrometers, chromatographs, plate readers, qPCR cyclers and other bench instruments. `openreadout self formats` lists them with their validation level.
- Sixteen commands: `info`, `check`, `preview`, `stats`, `trace`, `table`, `spectra`, `analyze`, `export`, `batch`, `link`, `index`, `search`, `watch`, `self` and `mcp`.
- JSON output on every command, with published JSON Schemas and documented exit codes.
- Verified export to OME-TIFF, OME-Zarr, mzML, CSV, Parquet, Arrow, NWB, JCAMP-DX, Allotrope ASM and RDML.
- Analyses of chromatograms, peaks, plate assays, qPCR, NMR spectra, patch-clamp recordings, extracellular spikes and flow-cytometry gates.
- An MCP server, an agent skill and a Claude Code plugin.
- A Python package with bioio and napari plugins, an R package, a WebAssembly build, and Nextflow, Galaxy and Snakemake integrations.
- A documentation website: task recipes with real output, a searchable format list taken from `self formats`, a JSON reference rendered from the published schemas, and a browser demo.
